## Description

A full-stack CRUD site for tracking personal habits.

Try out the app by either:
- Signing up with your own email
- Using the default Guest account
- Signing in with the following account: (Email: test@testing.com Password: 123456)

## Usage

Add a habit, and enter a name and difficulty. 
Each day, conduct a Daily Report (sidebar), which will add a day to successful habits and deduct days from unsuccessful habits.
Once a habit is formed, it will be greyed, and its date of completion will be displayed.
Click on a habit to remove it.

The number of days required for a habit, is based on [Atomic Habits author James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/new-habit)'s investigation that a habit takes 18, 66, or 254 days to form, depending on the difficulty of the habit.
